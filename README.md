# tensorflow-gpu-ubi8

Rebased Tensorflow on ubi8 base image

## Description

Tensorflow based on ubi8, adapted from [upstream docker defs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/dockerfiles/dockerfiles/gpu.Dockerfile)

NB: Not all "officially supported" versions of CUDA are actually published and available. (eg libNVinfer has no cuda11.2 support...)
